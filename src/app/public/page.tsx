          Our Story

        <p className="leading-7">
          The concept of{" "}
          <span className="font-bold text-[#742B1A]">
            The Legacy Project (TLP)
          </span>{" "}
          began in 2018, when{" "}
          <span className="font-bold text-[#742B1A]">Arielle Galinsky</span>, a
          high school junior at the time, spent her time working at a local
          senior community in her Massachusetts hometown. Her role allowed her
          to interact with the residents, which she greatly enjoyed, yet she
          always left her shift with a strong desire to learn more about the
          stories of the seniors she met. With this strong curiosity, paired
          with a deep sense of regret she felt having lost her own grandfathers
          at a young age, Arielle decided to spearhead{" "}
          <span className="font-bold text-[#742B1A]">TLP</span> as a personal
          project.
        </p>

        <p className="leading-7">
          The initiative encompassed conducting thorough interviews of 18
          residents living in the community, with the intention to hold a
          ceremony at the finale of the project to provide her older friends
          with the opportunity to share their stories with their families. When
          the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Arielle pivoted, and decided the best way
          to preserve the 18 captivating stories of the seniors she interviewed
          was through prose.
